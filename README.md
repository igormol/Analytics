# Analytics
Analytics is an AI tool using neural networks for real-time business insights. It offers RFM (compute/normalize/cluster scores with charts and tables), ABC (segment sales with bar/pie charts and table), churn analysis (K-Means visualizations), and three recommendation modes (client→product, hybrid, product→product) with top-10 suggestions.
